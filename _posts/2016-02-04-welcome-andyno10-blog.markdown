Hello, I'm Teng Yung Lin. I'm a web developer and designer living in Taipei, Taiwain.

I don't like to limit myself to developing with particular tools or programming languages, but
I'm most experienced with PHP, Javascript, and CSS. I also devoted myself to co-working skills and
how to write clean code. This means to consider communication and collaborator. This means team-first.
This means Agile, Scrum...

This blog is built by Jekyll. A RoR blog that transform your plain text into static websites and blogs.
I'd love to use this simple blog to share my ideas and concepts about coding stuffs.

Hope you guys will love my posts.
