Hi, my name is Teng Yung Lin. I'm a web developer and designer living in Taipei, Taiwain.

I don't like to limit myself to developing with particular tools or programming languages, but
I'm most experienced with PHP, Javascript, and CSS. I also devoted myself to co-working skills and
how to write clean code. This means to consider communication and collaborator. This means team-first.
This means Agile, Scrum...

I love to get things down and find solutions so as to achieve goals. I enjoy experiment with new
technology and incorporating it into my work flow when apporpriate. I also love open source and
find great values in metrics especially in terms of web technology.
